Integration Tests
=================

See also testcontainer/README
In this directory are integration tests; each sub-directory under here
specifies one.

They should have a README describing the test.

The should have an executable called "host_run" that runs the test.
This should:
  * start the "txtorcon-tester" container with an appropriate script,
    probably /txtorcon/integration/<test_name>/container_run
  * do whatever it takes to pass or fail the test
  * exit 0 if the test was successful, 1 if it failed.
