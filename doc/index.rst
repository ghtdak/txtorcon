txtorcon
========

.. note:: This code and (especially) documentation is currently a
    moving target. Might be best to clone from git and explore that
    way. These documents can be built with ``make doc`` if you have
    Sphinx installed.

    This documentation generated |today|.

    If there is some interest in this being released, I would put the
    code on GitHub and these pages somewhere accessible from the
    non-onion Web.

txtorcon is a `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`_-based `Python
<http://python.org/>`_ asynchronous controller library for `Tor
<https://www.torproject.org/>`_, following `control-spec
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/control-spec.txt>`_.
This would be of interest to anyone wishing to write event-based
software in Python that talks to a Tor program.
