class Circuit(object):

    Used by TorState to represent one of Tor's circuits.

    This is kept up-to-date by the L{TorState} that owns it, and
    individual circuits can be listened to for updates (or listen to
    every one using L{TorState.add_circuit_listener})

    @ivar path:
        contains a list of Router objects representing the path this
        Circuit takes. Mostly this will be 3 or 4 routers long. Note
        that internally Tor uses single-hop paths for some things. See
        also the L{purpose} instance-variable.

    @ivar streams:
        contains a list of Stream objects representing all streams
        currently attached to this circuit.

    @ivar state:
        contains a string from Tor describing the current state of the
        stream. From control-spec.txt section 4.1.2, these are:

            - NEW: New request to connect
            - NEWRESOLVE: New request to resolve an address
            - REMAP: Address re-mapped to another
            - SENTCONNECT: Sent a connect cell along a circuit
            - SENTRESOLVE: Sent a resolve cell along a circuit
            - SUCCEEDED: Received a reply; stream established
            - FAILED: Stream failed and not retriable
            - CLOSED: Stream closed
            - DETACHED: Detached from circuit; still retriable

    @ivar purpose:
        The reason this circuit was built. Values can currently be one
        of (but see control-spec.txt 4.1.1):

          - GENERAL
          - HS_CLIENT_INTRO
          - HS_CLIENT_REND
          - HS_SERVICE_INTRO
          - HS_SERVICE_REND
          - TESTING
          - CONTROLLER

        For most purposes, you'll want to look at GENERAL circuits only.

    @ivar id:
        The ID of this circuit, a number (or None if unset).
