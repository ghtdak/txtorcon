        You should return a Circuit instance which should be at state
        BUILT in the currently running Tor (you may get Circuits from
        an ICircuitContainer, which TorState implements). You may also
        return a Deferred which will callback with the desired
        circuit. In this case, you will probably need to be aware that
        the callback from TorState.build_circuit does NOT call back
        with a Circuit (just Tor's response of 'EXTEND 1234') and any
        circuit you do return must be in the BUILT state anyway (which
        the above will not). See examples/attach_streams_by_country.py
        for a complete example of using a Deferred in an
        IStreamAttacher.

        Alternatively, you may return None in which case the Tor
        controller will be told to choose a circuit itself.

        Note that Tor will refuse to attach to any circuit not in
        BUILT state; see ATTACHSTREAM in control-spec.txt

        Note also that you will not get a request to attach a stream
        that ends in .exit or .onion -- Tor won't let you specify how
        to attach .onion addresses anyway.
