Tor Timeout Test
================

In issue #59 it is reported that killing a Tor process launched with
launch_tor() can become wedged if we disconnect due to a timeout. 

That is, if you provide a timeout to launch_tor() and tor hasn't
launched by the time that timeout fires then the underlying Tor isn't
killed properly.

This integration test confirms this:

1. the container_run script calls launch_tor() with a 1 second
   timeout, and then does nothing

2. the host_run script waits an additional 5 seconds and then
   confirms that there is no Tor process running.
